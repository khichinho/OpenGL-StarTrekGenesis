This assignment is to implement Particle System to generate a sequence similar to 
Star Trek II Genesis 'The Wrath of Khan'( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXbWCrzWJo4 ).
This will demonstrate the following aspects.

Generation, rendering and animation of particle system simulating fire effects.
Modeling of planet as a sphere and rendering using displacement and bump mapping.
Modeling of terrain as fractal surfaces.
Camera motion from wide angle viewing to close ups.
